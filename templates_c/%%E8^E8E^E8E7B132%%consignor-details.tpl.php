<h1>Does it cost to sell my items and how much do I earn?</h1>
Consigner Fee is $8 which will be due at the time of drop off. You will then receive 50% or 60% of all of your sales! It’s that easy. By becoming a consigner, you will receive an EARLY SHOPPERS PASS which entitles you to shop before the public! <br />
<br />
