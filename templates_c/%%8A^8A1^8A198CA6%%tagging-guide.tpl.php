<h1>Tagging Guide</h1>
<h3>It is very important to follow the tagging instructions to ensure that your items are consistent with others and also to ensure that all of the needed information is on your items.</h3>

<h3>How do I tag my items?</h3>
<ul>
<span style="float: right;"><img src="images/tagged-item.jpg" style="margin: 7px; border: solid 2px #000000;" /><br /><br /><img src="images/tagged-item2.jpg" style="margin: 7px; border: solid 2px; #000000;" /></span>
<li> First, you must enter all of your items into the system, after you <a href="<?php echo $this->_tpl_vars['site_url']; ?>
/signup">sign up to be a consignor</a>.</li>

<li> All articles of clothing must be on a hanger and look like a question mark (where the opening of the hook faces your left.)</li>

<li>Be sure to use safety pins to attach the shoulder of all shirts and sleepers to the hanger to keep them from sliding off of the hanger.</li>

<li>Bottoms must be safety pined to the hanger as well. Do not fold pants over the hangers as shoppers will not be able to see them as well. Using large safety pins works best.</li>

<li>For shoes, socks and DVD’s you will need to place them inside of a plastic baggie and place the tag inside of the bag with them so it is visible. It is also a good idea to tape the tag to the inside of the bag with clear packaging tape to keep it from falling out as the shoes are taken out of the bags to try on.</li>

<li>For large toys and cribs, plastic ties work best but you may also use clear packaging tape. If you use plastic ties, it insures that tags do not get torn off at any time. Simply put a hole in the top of the tag and use the plastic tie to securely attach the tag to a visible place on the toy, stroller, crib, etc. If clear packaging tape is used, be sure to put plenty of tape completely covering the tag so that it cannot be torn off easily.</li>

<li>For toys that have several pieces, like a toy that comes with parts or pieces, the accessories need to be placed in a plastic baggie and securely attached to the toy.</li>

<li>Print all of your tags and cut.</li>

<li>Use safety pins to attach all tags to clothing in the upper left hand side of shirts, and left hand pocket area of pants.</li>

<li>Follow the above directions to tag your items.</li>
</ul>
